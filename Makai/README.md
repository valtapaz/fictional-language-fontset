# Makai Language

The Makai language itself is depicted as a cipher for the Japanese language written in Romanji characters. Unlike UltraMoji, there isn't an official key I know of, but as of this readme I've gotten every letter except L, P, Q, V, and X, of which P is the only letter with a direct Japanese counterpart (in fact, "CH" being romanized was the only reason I found the letter C). Note that until I at least find the letter P, this will be considered a beta, hence its version number (0.9.0). 

Unless a proper noun with letters foreign to Japanese appears, those other four letters will be a challenge; I may end up creating new symbols for them like how I did for UltraMoji, but the latter font was distinctly structured for kana and this one wasn't, so LQVX likely exist in some internal document at least.
