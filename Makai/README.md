# Makai Language

The Makai language itself is depicted as a cipher for the Japanese language written in Romanji characters. Unlike UltraMoji, there isn't an official key I know of, but as of this readme I've gotten every letter except L, Q, V, and X, none of which have direct Japanese counterparts (in fact, "CH" being romanized was the only reason I found the letter C). 

Unless a proper noun with letters foreign to Japanese appears, those other four letters will be a challenge; I may end up creating new symbols for them like how I did for UltraMoji, but the latter font was distinctly structured for kana and this one wasn't, so LQVX likely exist in some internal document at least. In any case, the core of the font is semi-complete, as far as its actual use as a Romanji cipher goes.
