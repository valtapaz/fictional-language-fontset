# Makai Language

The Makai language itself is depicted as an alphabetical cipher for the Japanese language written in Romanji characters. I deciphered every letter except L, Q, V, and X, none of which are used in Japanese, but learned a year later that there was indeed an official cipher, complete with numbers. The "old" directory includes my pre-cipher work, while this directory contains a font redrawn from the cipher from the ground up.

![The official Makai alphabet; as with some other ciphers, these letters seem loosely based on their latin counterparts, but not enough so to be easily recognized](https://imgsa.baidu.com/forum/w%3D580/sign=f459a2cda6014c08193b28ad3a7a025b/8af48645d688d43f9ae9be96721ed21b0ff43b0c.jpg)
