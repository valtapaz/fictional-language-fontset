CREDIT: 
This font and any custom characters are created by Mxyl Valtapazj, but the original Makai symbols are created and owned by its source franchise. It looks like there were several production companies behind it, so I'm not actually sure to what or whom it belongs.

ACTUAL LICENSE: 

- If you wish to use this for an official Garo-related project for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, please go ahead! I would love it if my work were used officially; there would not be any need to credit me, but I do ask that you let me know about it.

- If you are a fan or other unofficial user, feel free to use this font! Unless you're doing a really massive project (a good rule of thumb is, is there a credit section?), credit is not required but would be highly appreciated. I do ask that you not use this for any commercial business purpose (again, unless it's officially permitted by the copyright owners), unlawful conduct, or hateful or nsfw content.
