- If you wish to use this for an official Garo-related project for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, please go ahead! I would love it if my work were used officially; there would not be any need to credit me, but I do ask that you let me know about it.

- If you are a fan or other unofficial user, feel free to use this font! Unless you're doing a really massive project (a good rule of thumb is, is there a credit section?), credit is not required but would be highly appreciated. I do ask that you not use this for any commercial business purpose (again, unless it's officially permitted by the copyright owners), unlawful conduct, or hateful or nsfw content.
