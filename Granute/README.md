# Granute Language

Granute is a cipher for the English alphabet; it is also written in English, which conveniently means difficult letters like Q or X could be plausibly gotten. Starting with the "Stomach" logo, I was able to extrapolate enough to get a font out of it (unaware that another fan had already [done the same](https://x.com/vgz083/status/1834171443246178748)!). The system also has equivalents for the numbers 0-9 in addition to a separate numeral for the 10s place, which [appears to repeat](https://forums.tvnihon.com/viewtopic.php?p=300093&sid=86451fd18a2e438551b00081cc237646#p300093) Roman Numeral-style; I've mapped 10 to the "/" key for now.
