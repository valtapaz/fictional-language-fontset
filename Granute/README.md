# Granute Language

Granute is a cipher for the English alphabet; it is also written in English, which conveniently means difficult letters like Q or X could be plausibly gotten. Starting with the "Stomach" logo, I was able to extrapolate enough to get a font out of it. The system also has equivalents for the numbers 0-9 (possibly with a numeral for 10 as well), though I haven't added those yet.
