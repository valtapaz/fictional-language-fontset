# Elvendale Season 4 Rune Font

A fan-made font for the writing system of Elvendale, as seen in Season 4 of LEGO Elves' webisodes. 

LEGO's Elves franchise had a cipher system of sorts from its first year, but this mostly consisted of representative symbols corresponding to Latin letters; each subsequent year introduced a new writing system that may or may not have had any actual meaning, but it wasn't until its final year that Season 4's system was confirmed to be usable and then was deciphered. Thanks to [LEGO Elves Wiki](https://elvendale.fandom.com) users [Skyvola Salvator](https://elvendale.fandom.com/wiki/Message_Wall:Skyvola_Salvator?threadId=4400000000000001195), [Daffodillydoo](https://elvendale.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Daffodillydoo/Runes_deciphered_-_the_true_villain_of_season_4_revealed), and [The Elvendoodler](https://elvendale.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:The_Elvendoodler/Season_4_Rune_Key) for respectively discovering and starting; fully deciphering; and creating an unofficial rune key and filling in any missing letters (J, Q, X, and Z), respectively; these contributions were essential to this font's creation.
